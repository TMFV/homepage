                      ― I'm the most successful person ever to run for the

                      than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross
                      Perot isn't successful like me. Romney ― I have a Gucci
                      store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry losers and
                      haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all know
                      it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your

                            bureaucracy, but program offered courses in real

                            wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews
                            while studying, however some of these ungrateful
                            gringos filed lawsuits against Trump University
                            after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle

                            that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant
